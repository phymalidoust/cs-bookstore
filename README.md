## Book store and book repair workshop

Imagine a bookstore receives books that need to be repaired. According to workshop, the bookstore should divide the books into three categories (1) 'Ancient': Age>30y (2) "Old": 30>Age>10 (3) "Young": Age<10.

The sample code thus registers books and repair history with unique book and repair IDs.
